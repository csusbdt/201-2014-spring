<h2>Exercise 1: Tic Tac Toe (20 points)</h2>

<p>
Write a program that plays Tic Tac Toe with the user.
When you start the program,
the player that goes first is randomly decided.
The following code shows how to do this.
</p>

<pre>
if (rand() % 2 == 0) {
   // User goes first.
} else {
   // Computer goes first.
}
</pre>

<p>
The program displays a 3 by 3 grid, which is initially blank.
As each player takes a turn, an X or and O is added to the grid.
</p>

<p>
The computer should play intelligently.
In other words, the computer should never lose
and if the user makes a bad move, the computer should win.
